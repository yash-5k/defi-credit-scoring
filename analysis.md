ðŸ“‰ Low Score Range: Risky Behavior (0 - 300)

Wallets falling in the 0â€“300 score range often display characteristics such as:
Very low transaction counts, often just a few deposits
Short wallet age, sometimes just a few days
Low asset diversity â€” usually interacting with only 1 token
Minimal overall value deposited
Activity limited to 1â€“2 days, indicating lack of sustained engagement
Some show repetitive patterns or timestamp anomalies, suggesting bot-like behavior
These wallets are considered risky and may be:
Brand new users
Test wallets
Bots or potential exploiters

High Score Range: Trustworthy Behavior (700 - 1000)

Wallets in the higher credit score range exhibit behavior typical of long-term, consistent users:
Higher total USD deposit volume
Spread deposits across multiple tokens (asset diversity)
Longer wallet age, often 30+ days of activity
Regular, repeat transactions with steady frequency
Use of multiple protocols (when data allows)
These wallets often indicate:
Genuine DeFi users
Long-term holders or yield farmers
Low risk of manipulation or spam
